## Empty Project

Hello there, this is an empty project with a pseudo-decent (Work in progress) template to start you off with something good and easy.
It is built on laravel 4 and is easiest to use with composer (download / clone and then just run [composer install]! BAM)
it has some libraries already including:

JS:
modernizr - 2.8.3 CDN
jquery - 1.11.2 - CDN
angular.min.js - 1.4.5 - CDN
bootstrap.min.js Local

Styles:
Uses SASS for managing local styles
	-main.scss (includes the others into it's compiled file)
	-vars.scss
	-landing.scss
	-widgets.scss
jquery-ui.css - 1,11,0 Local
bootstrap.min.css - 3.3.0 Local
bootstrap-theme.min.css - 3.3.0 Local

This is a process so let's continue to work on it and build it up, I like working on the laravel stack and may start a 5 version as well once I get back up to speed with laravel. Really, this is just for me to use to get shit done quicker, but if other's like it (or even see it), go for it
